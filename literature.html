          <h2><em>"Black Seed, Grey Rose"</em></h2>
        </header>
          <p>
          I wasted my time watering a rose that will never bloom.
          Every day I woke with false hope that my dream will come true.
          Every day I slept disappointed and heartbroken.
            I’ve become addicted to tending to it even if it didn’t want me to.
          
          The rose withers.
          Yet my dedication does not die.
          This flower represents more than my hard work.
            It has always represented my unachieved dreams and the beauty that life hid from me.
          
          The flower becomes long dead but I remain in denial.
          As a vacuum widens within my heart.
          I continue to work and pray for a miracle.
          Something died along with my rose. 
          A lot died along with my rose.
          
          A miracle occurred – I uprooted the red corpse; destroying everything that I have ever idealized.
          I look at the dried broken petal and I see everything that I’ve ever lost.
          Yet I continue tending to it.
          It now bathes in my tears.

          <h2><em>"A Familiar Fairytale In Land For Far Away"</em></h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, in a land far far away
          There was a knight, answering a desperate cry for help 
          On his way to save a princess locked away in a tower 
          Guarded by a scaly dragon freightening  power
          On that day, when the knight arrived, the princess, intoxicated, was having sex and exchanging secrets with the dragon
          He heard wrong type of cry
          Because deep within this magical land, filled with kind powerful wizards and monsters.
          Was a kingdom where the royal knights and archers, used the foreign farmers and children as target practice
          While the monsters roam free within the walls of the castle, wearing crowns and throwing Banquets for every innocent life they take
          The boys, from their early ages are thought to be manly by being thrown into dungeons and are simultaneously expected to know how to waltz with mistresses when they come out.
          The girls, are taught that they're expected to attract men and know how to use enchantments to bend them to their bidding and they always carry knives .
          Because if a prince kisses you in your sleep it's to wake you up before raping you.
          If you had a spell that allows you to get anything you want in the world but in response..
          Causes someone you don't know in another far far away land to suffer or die.
          You'd have an accurate example for how the mana in this world worked.
          Within this fairytale, that spell not only exists but is widely esteemed, standing as the hope and day to day magic in any legendary mage's life.
          Here, in this magical, beautiful land far far away, it felt... oddly.. familiar.

          <h2><em>"Are you ready for another bad poem?"</em></h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          One that isn't supposed to be spoken 
          And not suitable for audiences
          These words, I didn't write them - they were stolen
          Gorged out painfully from an soul that can only make what it consumes   
          Consuming a  potion made of a mixture of experiences that no one can fully relate to 
          And the lethal dosage is still unknown
          I insist that this isn't a good poem nor a story.
          It's more like an incomplete recipe for a dish being made by a chef 
          And when the recipe is finally finished you won't be able to eat the meal because it'll be too cold.
          No.. not even that..  this?... this is a song. This is my background music made  in a language that only I know.
          Gibberish to you, that the only way you can understand. Is if you apply your own meaning to it.
          By using these words as a mirror you can have the see most beautiful spoken word ever performed or a tragedy to rival those of Shakespeare. 
          Do want to hear a good poem.. or do you want to hear something meaningful?
